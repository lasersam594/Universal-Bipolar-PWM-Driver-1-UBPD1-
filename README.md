UBPD1 runs on an Atmega328p Nano 3.0 and provides continuously variable PWM positive and negative drive to resistive and inductive loads
adjustable via a front panel knob and 2 line LCD.  The present hardware is geared toward a solenoid magnetic field driven with 15 VDC
power supply with up to +/-2 amps but this can be easeily changed via firmware parameter and the DC input voltage.
