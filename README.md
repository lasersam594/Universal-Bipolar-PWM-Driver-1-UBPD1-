UBPD1 runs on an Atmega328p Nano 3.0 and provides continuously variable PWM positive and negative drive adjustable via a front panel
knob and 2 line LCD.  The present hardware is geared toward a solenoid magnetic field with a 15 VDC power supply providing up to
+/-2 amps but this can be easeily changed via firmware parameters and the DC input voltage.
